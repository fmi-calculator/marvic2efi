## Overview

#### This exercise aims for facilitating knowledge exchange, data sharing, intercomparison and interoperability among MARVIC modelers by adopting common data standards. In addition, we aim to develop these standards further to formalize a way of reporting model/project domain and model/workflow errors in a quantitative manner. 

While doing this we don't want to start from scratch but build on existing efforts. In that sense, Ecological Forecasting Initiative (EFI) standards are a very promising candidate for MARVIC because there are many desirable design decisions in EFI standards that also fit for MRV purposes (probabilistic outcomes, uncertainty propagation, high dimensional outputs and so on).

## Getting Started
